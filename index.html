                <p>The motivation behind this project was to improve the existing website for Horiseon, a digital marketing agency, and make it more accessible and user-friendly.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improved code structure and organization.</li>
                        <li>Added Semantic HTML tags for better accessibility and readability, by removing the div element and separating the code by giving it a header, body, sections, and aside.</li>
                        <li>Accessible images with alt text for users with disabilities</li>
                        <li>Optimized CSS for better performance</li>
                        <li>Navigation links added to header for better user experience</li>

                <p>This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.</p>

                <p>This is my first website that I've made from scratch, I plan on adding more javascript elements to it in the future. I had sometime struggling with the styling of the website at first and as my skills improve they will start to reflect on this page. This was the first time adding images to my footer, all of the images have a clickable link to my social medias and will later add more pseudo elements to them.</p>
