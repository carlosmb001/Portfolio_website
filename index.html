                <p>Search for recipes and save them to a separate favorites page. Once on the favorites page, it is possible to select ingredients from the recipes and search for local stores that supply them close to your location as well as find local restaurants with similar dishes you favorited.

                </a>
                <p>The quiz consists of multiple-choice questions related to JavaScript. The user is presented with a question and four possible choices. The user selects an answer by clicking on one of the choices, and the program checks if the answer is correct. The user's score is incremented for each correct answer, and if the answer is incorrect, a penalty of 10 seconds is applied to the timer. The quiz is timed, and the user must complete it within a specified time limit. At the end of the quiz, the user's final score is displayed, and they have the option to submit their name and score to the high scores page.</p>

                <p>This is my first website that I've made from scratch, I plan on adding more javascript elements to it in the future. I had sometime struggling with the styling of the website at first and as my skills improve they will start to reflect on this page. This was the first time adding images to my footer, all of the images have a clickable link to my social medias and will later add more pseudo elements to them.</p>

                <p>This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.</p>
